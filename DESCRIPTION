Description: A suite of functions for conducting and interpreting analysis 
  of statistical interaction in regression models that was formerly part of the 
  'jtools' package. Functionality includes visualization of two- and three-way
  interactions among continuous and/or categorical variables as well as 
  calculation of "simple slopes" and Johnson-Neyman intervals (see e.g., 
  Bauer & Curran, 2005 <doi:10.1207/s15327906mbr4003_5>). These
  capabilities are implemented for generalized linear models in addition to the 
  standard linear regression context.
